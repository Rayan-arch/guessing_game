### Technologies.

I used 4 modules:
* Requests (2.23.0)
* Pprint (0.1)
* Json
* Html
And Python (3.8.1)

### Setup.

You need only an IDLE for python and those 4 modules.
For istalling Requests, Pprint, Json and Html on your powershell(for windows) type
"pip install requests",
"pip install pprint",
"pip install json".
Or visit web site 
https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 
https://pypi.org/project/pprintpp/
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1389141/how-to-add-json-library
There is instruction on how to install on all systems.
Module html is already instaled on your computer.
