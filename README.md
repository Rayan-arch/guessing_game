### Technologies.

I used 4 modules:
* Requests (2.23.0)

And Python (3.8.1)

### Setup.

You need only an IDLE for python and those 4 modules.
For istalling Requests, Pprint, Json and Html on your powershell(for windows) type
"pip install requests",
"pip install pprint",
"pip install json".
Or visit web site

There is instruction on how to install on all systems.
Module html is already instaled on your computer.
